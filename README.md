# JavaScript starter kit

First of all, go to http://monkeymusicchallenge.com, sign up and get your API key.

To understand this starter kit you will need to have basic knowledge of:

* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)

You will also need to have `node` and `npm` installed properly on your system.

Google can help you get everything set up!

## Usage

Start by [forking](https://github.com/monkey-music-challenge/javascript-starter-kit/fork)
this repository to your own GitHub user.

Then, open up a terminal and:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/javascript-starter-kit.git
cd javascript-starter-kit
npm install
node index.js <your-team-name> <your-api-key>
```

These are all UNIX commands. Got Windows? We recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

Make sure to surf to your team page before running the above commands...

Your monkey is waiting for you!

## Get started

In `index.js`, we've put all the boilerplate code needed to communicate with the server.

You should not need to change anything in here.

Instead, go to `ai.js` and start playing around with the code.

Remember, your mission is to guide your monkey through the warmup level, pick up all the music items and get them to the eagerly awaiting Spotify user.

Have fun!
