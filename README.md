# Monkey Music Challenge: JavaScript Starter Kit

Before you get started here, make sure you have signed up at http://monkeymusicchallenge.com.

To participate in the warmup, go to http://warmup.monkeymusicchallenge.com and get an API key for your team.

Then head over to your team page to get more detailed instructions on the game itself.

To understand this starter kit you will need to have basic knowledge of:

* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)

You will also need to have `node` and `npm` installed properly on your system.

Google can help you get everything set up!

## Usage

First of all, `fork` this repository to your own github user.

Next, open up a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/javascript-starter-kit.git
cd javascript-starter-kit
npm install
node index.js <your-team-name> <your-api-key>
```

These are all UNIX commands. Got Windows? We recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

Make sure to surf to your team page before running the above commands... Your monkey is waiting for you!

## Get started

`index.js` contains the boilerplate needed to communicate with the server. You should not need to change anything in here.

In `ai.js`, you can put your AI code.

In order to complete the challenge, guide your monkey through the level, pick up all the music and get it to the user!

AI and pathfinding ftw!
