# JavaScript starter kit

## Prerequisites

First of all, go to http://monkeymusicchallenge.com, sign up and get your API key.

For this starter kit, you will need to have basic knowledge of:

* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)

Make sure to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your system.

Google can help you get everything set up!

Prefer another language? Check out our [Java](https://github.com/monkey-music-challenge/java-starter-kit) or [Python](https://github.com/monkey-music-challenge/python-starter-kit) starter kits.

## Usage

Start by [forking](https://github.com/monkey-music-challenge/javascript-starter-kit/fork)
this repository to your own GitHub user.

Then, open up a terminal and:

```
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/javascript-starter-kit.git
cd javascript-starter-kit
npm install
node index.js <your-team-name> <your-api-key>
```

These are all UNIX commands. Got Windows? We recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

Make sure to surf to your team page before running the above commands...

Your monkey is waiting for you!

## Get started

In `index.js`, we've put all the boilerplate code needed to communicate with the Monkey Music server.

We suggest you go straight to `ai.js` and start playing around with the code.

Remember, your mission is to:

* guide your monkey through the warmup level
* pick up all the music items
* get them to the eagerly awaiting Spotify user

Have fun!
